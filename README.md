# MVCheckBundle

Some custom [Mapset Verifier](https://github.com/Naxesss/MapsetVerifier) checks I wrote to make my hobby nominating maps on osu! a bit easier.

This is my first time interacting with a larger codebase so sincere apologies if my code is not up to standards.

For any questions or complaints, feel free to open an issue or let me know directly via [osu! dms](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10959501) or Discord `@enneya`.
